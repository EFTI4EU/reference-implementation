# Contributing guidelines to eFTI4EU Reference implementation

Before staring work on this project, please coordinate with eFTI4EU about participating in the development effort. This
will ensure that your work is aligned with the project's goals and that you are not duplicating work that is already in
development.

## Pull requests

One pull request should contain changes that are related to a single issue, preferable work that is agreed beforehand in
eFTI4EU TG5. You should name the branch and the pull request with the Jira ticket when applicable, for example
`EFTI-1234-fix-something`.

The pull requests cannot be merged unless they pass the automated test set and have a passing review. It is good
practice the get a review from out of your own organization, to ensure that all parties are aligned on the direction of
development.

Merging is to be done with Squash and merge to keep the history clean and concise.
